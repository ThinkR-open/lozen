# `build_pkgdown_with_reports()` : build a pkgdown with coverage and test reports

This function will generate the pkgdown of the current package using `{pkgdown}`, together with the `{covr}` and `{testdown}` reports. These reports will be embedded inside the pkgdown and accessible through the navigation bar. It requires the functions `covr::report()`, `testdown::test_down`, `gitdown::git_down` that are suggested package imports from `{lozen}`.
