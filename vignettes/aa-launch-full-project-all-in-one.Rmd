# Init a new project with everything in one command

`init_project_with_all()` will follow the ThinkR recommended configuration to init a new project.
By default, the project is a R package created on <https://gitlab.com/> in your personal repository.  
After that, you only have to start writing the code ! 

You can amend the default configuration with your own yaml file.
Open the default one: `file.edit(system.file("config_default_thinkr_gitlab.yml", package = "lozen"))`.  
Keep only lines that you would like to change, and save your own configuration where you like it to be.  
Next time you can run `init_project_with_all(project_name = "my.wonderful.project", config_path = "path/to/my/own/config.yaml")`. 


```{r example-init_project_with_all, eval = FALSE}
if (interactive()) {
  # Default on GitLab.com
  init_project_with_all(project_name = "newprojectpkg")
  # Change default options with your own config file
  init_project_with_all(project_name = "newprojectpkg", config_path = "<my-config-path>")
  # Add any extra option to override values of your config file once
  init_project_with_all(project_name = "newprojectpkg", config_path = "<my-config-path>", gitlab_namespace_id = "000")
}
```
