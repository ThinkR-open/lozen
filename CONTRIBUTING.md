# Contributing to {lozen}

This outlines how to propose a change to {lozen}. 
For more detailed info about contributing to this, and other tidyverse packages, please see the
[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib). 

## All contribution welcomed

We are open to any contribution, from typos to new features. 
We will guide you throughout the process and make you in a safe position to contribute,
whatever is your level in R programming.

## {lozen} partly uses {fusen} with flat files

For more details about {fusen} please the [**GitHub repo of {fusen}**](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/fusen). 

Multiple files of the package in "R/", "tests/" and "vignettes/" are issued from a flat file.
When this is the case, you will see this Warning on top of the file:

> "# WARNING - Generated by {fusen} from dev/flat_xxx.Rmd: do not edit by hand"

This means that you will need to make your changes in the corresponding flat file, 
and then `inflate()` this same flat file. 
We recommend using `fusen::inflate_all()` directly so that it takes into account any modification.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. 
This generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. 
You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. 
If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).

### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github("ThinkR-open/lozen", fork = TRUE)`.

*   Follow the `Use {lozen} as developer` of the README to set all needed environment variables, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. 
    
*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init("brief-description-of-change")`.

*   Make your changes

*   Open the dev/dev_history_package.Rmd file: `rstudioapi::navigateToFile("dev/dev_history_package.Rmd")`

Find the "# Each time, before pushing to the server" part and run the commands in the chunks.

*   Commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.

### Code style

*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). 
    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  

*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  

*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. 
   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
