The objective of {lozen} is to centralize project management tools for Devs and Lead Devs.

To use the package, as user or as developer, you will have to define some tokens and environment variables. Go to the dedicated section below "Use {lozen} as user" or "Use {lozen} as developer".

# Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github(
  repo = "ThinkR-open/lozen",
  ref = "main",
  build_vignettes = TRUE,
  upgrade = "never")
```


# Use of the package, depending if you are a user or a developer

## Use {lozen} as user

You need to use this kind of `.Renviron` file:

```
GITLAB_TOKEN="my.token.generated.in.gitlab"
GITLAB_URL="my.gitlab.url"
GITHUB_PAT="my.personal.access.token.generated.in.github"
CONNECT_URL="my.connect.url"
CONNECT_NAME="my.connect.server.name"
CONNECT_USER="my.connect.username"
CONNECT_TOKEN="my.api.key.generated.in.connect"
```

You can use the command line `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to open a `.Renviron` file. Save the values inside as mentioned above, and restart your R session.

Depending on your needs, you will have to set all of them (GitLab, GitHub and Posit Connect), or just some of them. See the details sections below to have more information about how to create them.

## Use {lozen} as developer

**Note that unit tests will create and publish some elements on your own instances (GitLab, GitHub, Posit Connect).** These objects will be automatically deleted at the end of the tests.

You need to use this kind of `.Renviron` file:

```
GITLAB_TOKEN="my.token.generated.in.gitlab"
GITLAB_URL="my.gitlab.url"
ALLOW_CI_TESTS_ON_GITLAB="TRUE"
GITHUB_PAT="my.personal.access.token.generated.in.github"
CONNECT_URL="my.connect.url"
CONNECT_NAME="my.connect.server.name"
CONNECT_USER="my.connect.username"
CONNECT_TOKEN="my.api.key.generated.in.connect"
ALLOW_TESTS_TO_DEPLOY_ON_CONNECT="TRUE"
```

You can use the command line `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to open a `.Renviron` file. Save the values inside as mentioned above, and restart your R session.

You will have to set all of them (GitLab, GitHub and Posit Connect), to be sure all unit tests can be launched. See the details sections below to have more information about how to create them.

Please note that unit tests using `{gert}` might show a prompt asking for your gitlab username and password. For the latter, you must provide your gitlab password, not a token.

## More details about how to create tokens and define environment variables

### GitLab

- `GITLAB_TOKEN`: Create a personal access token on GitLab, with the rights: "read_repository", "write_repository", "api", "read_api"
- `GITLAB_URL`: url of your gitlab instance - if this is `gitlab.com`, you do not have to specify it, because this is the default value used by the package

### GitHub

- `GITHUB_PAT`: Create a personal access token on GitHub - please note that if you wish to use the function `gh_create_weekly_old_and_new_boards()` the `read:project` scope must be provided with your token

### Posit Connect

- `CONNECT_URL`: Url of your Posit Connect
- `CONNECT_NAME`: Name of your Posit Connect server - to know this information, please use `rsconnect::accounts()$server`. if this is `connect`, you do not have to specify it, because this is the default value defined by Posit Connect once a first connection has been made to the server
- `CONNECT_USER`: Your username in your Posit Connect
- `CONNECT_TOKEN`: Personal access token of your Posit Connect - please follow the [official documentation](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/api-keys/) to create it
